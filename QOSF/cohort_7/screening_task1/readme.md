```The problem asked to find the largest number between two integers, either positive or negative.```

Here I solved the problem for given numbers
 - *positive and negative*
 - *less than 16 greater than -16* (uses about 30 qubits, which is a limitation when simulating on a regular classical computer)
 
I used grovers search and followed [[1]](https://www.educative.io/answers/what-is-a-quantum-binary-comparator)[[2]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228574906) resources as a guide.
